// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

const markMass = 78;
const MarkHeight = 1.69;
const johnMass = 92;
const johnHeight = 1.95;

const MarkBMI = markMass / (MarkHeight * MarkHeight);
const johnBMI = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);

const markHigherBmi = MarkBMI > johnBMI;

// printing results
console.log(`marks bmi: ${MarkBMI}`);
console.log(`john bmi: ${johnBMI}`);
console.log(`Mark has a higher Bmi than john: ${markHigherBmi}`);
